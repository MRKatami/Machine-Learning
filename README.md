Student Score Prediction
This project is a simple template for predicting student scores based on the number of study hours. 
The dataset used consists of two columns: Hours (x) and Scores (y).

Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Analyze the distribution of hours and scores.
2. Feature Engineering:
   Check for duplicated data.
   Handle missing values (if any).
   Conduct outlier analysis.
3. Machine Learning Modeling:
   Implement at least two regression models, such as:
   Linear Regression
   Decision Tree Regressor
   Random Forest Regressor

4. Model Evaluation:
  Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
  Compare performance and select the best-performing model.

5. Conclusion:
  Summarize the results and determine which model works best.

Usage
The notebook template walks you through loading the dataset, performing EDA, feature engineering, training models, and evaluating them. Ensure you have the dataset student_scores.xlsx in the correct path.
