Student Score Prediction
This project is a simple template for predicting student scores based on the number of study hours. The dataset used consists of two columns: Hours (x) and Scores (y).

Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of hours and scores.

Feature Engineering:

Check for duplicated data.

Handle missing values (if any).

Conduct outlier analysis.

Machine Learning Modeling:

Implement at least two regression models, such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.

Compare performance and select the best-performing model.

Conclusion:

Summarize the results and determine which model works best.
